Transaction
===========
A Transaction is single logical unit of work that modifies data.

ACID
====
In order to maintain consistency of data before and after transaction, ACID properties are followed.

A - Atomicity
C - Consistency
I - Isolation
D - Durability

Atomicity - This means that the entire transaction takes place at once or doesn't happen at all.

Consistency - Maintain data integrity. If there is a constraint violation, the transaction is rolled back.

Isolation - Each transaction happens in a queue one by one. Multiple transactions can happen at a same time, if same row gets modified by multiple transaction, then one transaction waits for another transaction to complete.

Durability - The changes made during the transaction lasts long.

Read Phenomena
==============
Isolation levels define the degree to which a transaction must be isolated from data modification.

Dirty Read - Does not get the data modified by another transaction.

Non Repeatable Read - When a transaction reads a row twice, and get a different value each time.

Phantom Read - Phantom Read occurs when two same queries retrieves two different set of results.
