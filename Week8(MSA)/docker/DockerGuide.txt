Demo for running docker container from dockerhub:
-For any public directory with docker images the command for running the image is:
docker run -d profileName/directoryName:tagName

-You can use my public profile where I have a sample springboot application:
docker run -t -dp 9000:9000 alejandrooro99/project1:13   -this command runs my custom container on your machine's port 9000

Useful docker commands:
docker images : shows images on your system
docker start/kill : will start or stop a container
docker ps : will show all running containers
docker build : will build an image using docker file 
docker run : will run a container if not found on system will search dockerhub for it

Demo for Dockerizing and using docker compose:
-Dockerfile must be declared with base image and any extra modules you want to add, in our case a .jar file will be copied into
the file system of the container as well as java installed.

-docker build -t name_of_image .  -this command will build an image with name_of_image as its name
-docker run -t -d name_of_image will run container(-p flag is optional and used for mapping container ports in use to host ports).

-docker-compose.yaml will contain setup for docker-compose, using build with dockerfiles and mapping ports in the .yaml file for use
-In our example .yaml file we run two identical springboot apps simultaneously on 2 different ports defined in the .yaml file, with
docker-compose build command(on the same directory as docker/.yaml files) docker will build the two containers and docker-compose up
will run them simultaneously and then entering the file system of the containers and starting up the springboot apps will allow you to
use the applications(can be tested with postman).
